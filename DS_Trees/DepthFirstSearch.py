Time Complexity
Since all the nodes and vertices are visited, the average time complexity for DFS on a graph is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
In case of DFS on a tree, the time complexity is O(V), where VV is the number of nodes.

We say average time complexity because a setâ€™s in operation has an average time complexity of O(1). 
If we used a list, the complexity would be higher.
